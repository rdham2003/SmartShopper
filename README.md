# SmartShopper

**🧠🛍️About SmartShopper🛍️🧠**

SmartShopper is an E-commerce website templete I created in order to express all the skills, tools, and technologies I have learnt and gathered over the past 6 months. It is a full-stack application that utilizes Front-end, Back-end, Database, CRUD storage, RESTful APIs, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

**💡Inspiration💡**
In January of 2024, my father had signed up for a hackathon that involved some form of ML integration. Originally, we wanted to create a E-commerce website with a Chatbot customer support. However, none of us had the necesary tools, skills, or knowledge to create a product such as that. I spent the past 6 months mastering the skills of Full-stack application development and RESTful APIs. During this time, I also took time to learn about ML and DL through Python libraries such as Pytorch and Sci-Kit Learn.
